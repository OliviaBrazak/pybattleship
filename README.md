# pybattleship

•To run: 
` python3 battleship_welcome.py`


•What is the project?:

A python battleship game with an AI algorithm. Prompts the user to place the battleships then asks if they want to play       against an AI or another person. If AI is chosen there is an algorithm to place the ships and an algorithm to hit placeson   the board and if a ship is found it targets around the inital hit.


•Why did I make it?:

To better understand strings and general aspects of python. The battleship game gave me a good visual to see the results of   my code thus making it easier for me to target my mistakes.


•What I learned?: 

list comprehension
general python programming techniques
(most python i learned was by doing this)
how to structure a project
C syntax/ mechanics (started the project in C)


•What was the hardest part?: 

Putting a project together in an efficent way. I'm not used to doing things without a specific guild line to follow like a   homeowrk assignment. I had to start thinking logically how to make the code more efficent.


•If you kept working on it, what would you fix/add/do better?:

I want to make the game an SSH game, and in C eventually. Short term I want to add a function that if you guess a 				coordinate twice it lets you retry, an update when you sink any part of a ship on the board, and a cleaner ship placement. 


•Time spent?:

25 hours
